The quick connection button for the website.

= How does the widget work? =

You set the widget code to your website. 
Once a potential customer leaves you his phone number and click on Call me button, 
Pulsar system calls and connects him in 27 seconds to the first free manager.

= What will be if my telephone line is busy? =

You can specify more than one number to receive incoming calls and set up dial-up script (consistent / parallel).
Under script «Consistent»: if the number of the first employee is busy, our service calls the next free manager from the list of numbers you have specified.
Under script «Parallel»: call goes simultaneously on all numbers mentioned and connects with the manager who answers the call first.

= Where will goes call if there is no one in the office? =

After hours the widget works in the night mode, offering visitors to write a letter or to order a call at an appropriate time the next business day.
